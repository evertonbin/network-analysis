## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the necessary libraries to run the code were already available in Anaconda distribution of Python. This script was written using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I use a company's e-mail network data to extract features in order to predict salary and future connections between employees.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. Notebook - Jupyter Notebook with the script developed for extracting features and making predictions.
2. Licensing - MIT License covering this project.

Observation: the files used in the project were made available only through the Coursera platform, and that is why they were not made available here.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The result is two pandas Series: one indicating management salary probability for employees with missing information, and another indicating probability of connection between two employees that haven't already reached each other.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credits must be given to the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) for making the data available along in its [Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis) course available in Coursera platform.
